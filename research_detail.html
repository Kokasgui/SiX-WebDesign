    <!-- SECÇÃO 1_INTRODUCTION -->
    <section>
      <p>
        The SiX project is breaking down communication barriers for people
        with Locked-in Syndrome (LIS) through the power of digital drawing.
        Note: This webpage offers a simplified overview of the research
        project "Drawing for Social Re-connectivity through Collaborative and
        Digital Environments. Preliminary Drawing Activities." You can find
        the full paper online at [Insert hyperlink to the PDF:
        DrawingforSocialReconectivity.pdf here].

    <!-- SECÇÃO 2_WHAT IS LIS_2 ARTICLES-->
    <section>
      <h2>What is LIS?</h2>
      <p>
        Imagine being fully aware of your surroundings but unable to move or
        speak. That's the reality for people with LIS, a condition that
        affects muscle control but leaves cognitive function intact. This can
        lead to feelings of isolation and frustration, making communication
        incredibly difficult.

          <h2>How can drawing help?</h2>
          <p>
            Drawing offers a universal language that transcends words. The SiX
            project aims to develop a digital drawing system that allows
            people with LIS to express themselves creatively and connect with
            others in a meaningful way.

          <h2>How does it work?</h2>
          <p>
            The system will utilize cutting-edge technology like eye-tracking
            and brain-computer interfaces to translate even the smallest
            movements into drawing commands. This will allow users to create
            art, communicate messages, and even interact with their
            environment in a whole new way.
