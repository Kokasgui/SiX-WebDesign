        The SiX project is breaking down communication barriers for people with
        Locked-in Syndrome (LIS) through the power of digital drawing. Note:
        This webpage offers a simplified overview of the research project
        "Drawing for Social Re-connectivity through Collaborative and Digital
        Environments. Preliminary Drawing Activities." You can find the full
        paper online at [Insert hyperlink to the PDF:
        DrawingforSocialReconectivity.pdf here].

      <h2>What is LIS?</h2>
      <p>
        Imagine being fully aware of your surroundings but unable to move or
        speak. That's the reality for people with LIS, a condition that affects
        muscle control but leaves cognitive function intact. This can lead to
        feelings of isolation and frustration, making communication incredibly
        difficult.
