    <!-- Secção 1_ABOUT SiX RESEARCH PROJECT-->
    <section>
      <p>
        SiX stands for "Drawing for Social Re-connectivity”. Exploring
        Inclusive, Collaborative and Digital Environments for Patients with
        Partial to Complete Locked-In Syndrome." This research project aims to
        break down communication barriers for individuals with partial to
        complete Locked-in Syndrome (LIS) using digital drawing as a
        non-verbal tool. SiX transforms limited physical or ocular movements
        into digital drawing commands by using the human body itself as the
        interface. The project is built on the principle that creative
        expression and communication are fundamental human needs, especially
        for those with severe motor limitations.
      </p>
      <p>
        LIS, often caused by brain stem damage, is a neurological condition
        that results in paralysis of almost all voluntary muscles. Individuals
        with LIS frequently retain full cognitive function, but struggle to
        express themselves and interact with their surroundings. SiX seeks to
        provide LIS patients with a more expressive and engaging form of
        communication that goes beyond conventional spelling interfaces or
        communication boards.

        <p>
          While "Mission and Action Lines" are not specifically laid out for
          SiX in the sources, the project's goals and methodologies suggest
          the following:
        </p>
      </summary>
      <h3>Empowering Communication and Expression</h3>
      <p>
        Communication and Expression Giving LIS patients the ability to
        communicate their thoughts, emotions, and needs via digital drawing.
      </p>
      <h3>Fostering Social Connection</h3>
      <p>
        Making it easier for LIS patients to have meaningful interactions and
        connections with their peers, families, and caregivers.
      </p>
      <h3>Improving Quality of Life</h3>
      <p>
        Enhancing the well-being and quality of life of LIS patients by
        providing a creative outlet and a means of social engagement.
      </p>
      <h3>Bridging Art, Design, and Technology</h3>
      <p>
        Combining art, design, and assistive technology to develop novel
        communication and healthcare solutions.
      </p>

        <h2>Research Topics <i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i></h2>
        <p>SiX focuses on several key research areas:</p>
      </summary>
      <h3>Digital Drawing as a Communication Tool</h3>
      <p>
        Exploring how effective digital drawing is at conveying complex
        emotions and ideas for LIS patients.
      </p>
      <h3>Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)</h3>
      <p>
        Examining how the human body can function as an interface, translating
        even the smallest movements into drawing commands.
      </p>
      <h3>Design for Health</h3>
      <p>
        Developing user-centred design strategies that meet the specific needs
        and capabilities of LIS patients.
      </p>
      <h3>Collaborative and Immersive Environments</h3>
      <p>
        Creating digital environments where LIS patients and their support
        networks can interact and collaborate.
      </p>

        <p>The SiX project expects to achieve the following key outputs:</p>
      </summary>
      <h3>A set of digital drawing activities</h3>
      <p>
        Specifically created to help LIS patients communicate and express
        themselves.
      </p>
      <h3>Guidelines and manual of procedures</h3>
      <p>
        Providing clear instructions on how to use and implement the digital
        drawing tools.
      </p>
      <h3>Replicable prototypes</h3>
      <p>
        Allowing healthcare providers to use and test the technology in their
        settings.
      </p>
      <h3>An online collaborative platform</h3>
      <p>
        Enabling LIS patients and their support networks to connect and
        collaborate from anywhere.
      </p>
      <h3>A white paper</h3>
      <p>
