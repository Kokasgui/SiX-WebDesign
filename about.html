        <p>
          SiX stands for "Drawing for Social Re-connectivity”. Exploring
          Inclusive, Collaborative and Digital Environments for Patients with
          Partial to Complete Locked-In Syndrome." This research project aims to
          break down communication barriers for individuals with partial to
          complete Locked-in Syndrome (LIS) using digital drawing as a
          non-verbal tool. SiX transforms limited physical or ocular movements
          into digital drawing commands by using the human body itself as the
          interface. The project is built on the principle that creative
          expression and communication are fundamental human needs, especially
          for those with severe motor limitations.
        </p>
        <p>
          LIS, often caused by brain stem damage, is a neurological condition
          that results in paralysis of almost all voluntary muscles. Individuals
          with LIS frequently retain full cognitive function, but struggle to
          express themselves and interact with their surroundings. SiX seeks to
          provide LIS patients with a more expressive and engaging form of
          communication that goes beyond conventional spelling interfaces or
          communication boards.
