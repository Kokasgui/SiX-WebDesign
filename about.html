      <p>
        SiX stands for "Drawing for Social Re-connectivity”. Exploring
        Inclusive, Collaborative and Digital Environments for Patients with
        Partial to Complete Locked-In Syndrome." This research project aims to
        break down communication barriers for individuals with partial to
        complete Locked-in Syndrome (LIS) using digital drawing as a
        non-verbal tool. SiX transforms limited physical or ocular movements
        into digital drawing commands by using the human body itself as the
        interface. The project is built on the principle that creative
        expression and communication are fundamental human needs, especially
        for those with severe motor limitations.
      </p>
      <p>
        LIS, often caused by brain stem damage, is a neurological condition
        that results in paralysis of almost all voluntary muscles. Individuals
        with LIS frequently retain full cognitive function, but struggle to
        express themselves and interact with their surroundings. SiX seeks to
        provide LIS patients with a more expressive and engaging form of
        communication that goes beyond conventional spelling interfaces or
        communication boards.
