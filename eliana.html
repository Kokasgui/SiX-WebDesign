      <p>
        Eliana Santiago is an Assistant Professor of Design and Drawing at the
        Faculty of Fine Arts of the University of Porto (FBAUP). She completed
        her degree in Visual Communication Design in 1997 and began her career
        in web and interaction design at a pioneering e-commerce company. Her
        interest in Computational Media and Digital Grammars, Languages and
        Processes led her to a Master's degree in Multimedia Digital Arts in
        2000. Santiago's teaching experience in higher education began in 2003
        at Escola Superior de Artes e Design (ESAD). She later earned her PhD
        in Drawing from the Universidad Politécnica de Valencia, Facultad de
        Bellas Artes de San Carlos in 2012. Her dissertation, "El Arte del
        Azar: Incidencias del Acaso en el Arte Electrónico," explored the role
        of chance in electronic art.
      </p>
      <p>
        Santiago is an integrated researcher at ID+, a research unit comprised
        of 12 working groups. Her work aligns with the Head group's focus on
        applied research in multidisciplinary contexts. She is also a
        collaborating researcher at i2ADS, working within the research program
        for Computation, Hybrid Practices and Culture
      </p>
      <p>
        Santiago has extensive experience supervising postgraduate research,
        including one ongoing PhD thesis, 20 completed MA projects, and two
        ongoing projects. Many of these were developed in interdisciplinary
        settings with collaborations from researchers and experts from
        different fields of expertise, such as physicians, psychologists, and
        therapists. She has also coordinated and co-organised five seminars
        titled "MAIS DO QUE A SOMA" under the WT project
        (POCI-01-0145-FEDER-029038) and the Annual Design Research Forum since
        2021 as part of the MA in Design for Health and Wellbeing (MDSBE).
        Santiago is regularly invited as a moderator and speaker at academic
        and artistic events on design education, creative coding, and
        computation in the arts and design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her research outputs in Design for Health have highlighted the impact
        of design research in health and laid the groundwork for integrating
        technology and computational design with health design research. These
        outputs include projects such as "Health & Design at Service of a
        Refugee Camp in Iraq," "Cohort Study Good Practices: Design
        Communication & Capacitation Processes," and "Designing for People
        with Dementia: A Portuguese Case Study."
