        <strong>SiX</strong> is a research project that explores how digital
        drawing can help patients with Locked-in Syndrome (LIS) reconnect
        socially and express themselves. The project uses the human body as an
        interface, converting minimal physical movements into drawing
        commands. This approach recognizes that creative expression is a
        fundamental human need, particularly important for those with severe
        motor impairments.

        <h3>Research/Publications</h3>
        <p>
          The SiX project will produce a variety of publications, including:
        </p>
        <div id="research-box" class="hidden">
          <h4>Scientific papers</h4>
          <p>
            Published in peer-reviewed journals, disseminating the project's
            findings and contributing to the scientific understanding of LIS
            and assistive technologies.
          </p>
          <h4>Design guidelines and manuals</h4>
          <p>
            Providing practical guidance for designers and developers creating
            communication tools for LIS patients.
          </p>
          <h4>White papers and reports</h4>
          <p>
            Documenting the project's methodology, results, and
            recommendations.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            These publications will bridge the gap between research and
            practice, encouraging the development of innovative solutions that
            improve the lives of LIS patients.
