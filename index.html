          SiX is a research project that explores how digital drawing can help
          patients with Locked-in Syndrome (LIS) reconnect socially and
          express themselves. The project uses the human body as an interface,
          converting minimal physical movements into drawing commands. This
          approach recognizes that creative expression is a fundamental human
          need, particularly important for those with severe motor
          impairments.
