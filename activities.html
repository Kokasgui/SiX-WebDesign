          The SiX Research Project is dedicated to enhancing communication and
          accessibility for individuals with Locked-in Syndrome (LIS). Through
          collaborative efforts, the project explores digital drawing as a
          communication tool, involving patients, caregivers, healthcare
          professionals, researchers, and students.

          <h3>Research/Publications</h3>
          <p>
            The SiX project will produce a variety of publications, including:
          </p>
          <div id="research-box" class="hidden">
            <h4>Scientific papers</h4>
            <p>
              Published in peer-reviewed journals, disseminating the project's
              findings and contributing to the scientific understanding of LIS
              and assistive technologies.
            </p>
            <h4>Design guidelines and manuals</h4>
            <p>
              Providing practical guidance for designers and developers creating
              communication tools for LIS patients.
            </p>
            <h4>White papers and reports</h4>
            <p>
              Documenting the project's methodology, results, and
              recommendations.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              These publications will bridge the gap between research and
              practice, encouraging the development of innovative solutions that
              improve the lives of LIS patients.
