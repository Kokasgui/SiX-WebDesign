          The SiX Research Project is dedicated to enhancing communication and
          accessibility for individuals with Locked-in Syndrome (LIS). Through
          collaborative efforts, the project explores digital drawing as a
          communication tool, involving patients, caregivers, healthcare
          professionals, researchers, and students.

          <h3>Exploratory phase</h3>
          <p>
            Led by Bruno Giesteira, this phase focuses on understanding the
            needs of individuals with LIS and their caregivers. Key activities
            include:
          </p>
          <div id="exploratory-box" class="hidden">
            <h4>Observational Fieldwork</h4>
            <p>
              Researchers, under the guidance of therapist Filipe Gonçalves,
              will observe patients in therapeutic settings at APELA (Portuguese
              Association for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis), focusing on
              cognitive, motor, and social interactions.
            </p>
            <h4>Stakeholder Workshops</h4>
            <p>
              These sessions will gather insights from caregivers and therapists
              involved in LIS care, promoting knowledge exchange.
            </p>
            <h4>User Interviews</h4>
            <p>
              Ethnographic interviews and shadow observations will explore the
              daily routines and challenges of LIS patients.
            </p>
            <h4>Preliminary Drawing Activities</h4>
            <p>
              Pilot drawing sessions will investigate how drawing can act as a
              communication medium in immersive digital settings, exploring
              themes like distant memory and spatial memory.

          <h3>Development and Testing Phase</h3>
          <p>
            This phase, led by Pedro Amado, aims to design and test a prototype
            system using digital drawing to translate minimal movements into
            digital commands. Key tasks include:

            <h4>Persona Development</h4>
            <p>
              Personas representing LIS users are created to refine design
              focus.
            </p>
            <h4>Co-Design Workshops</h4>
            <p>
              Stakeholders collaboratively refine the prototypes using an agile
              methodology, ensuring real-world relevance.
            </p>
            <h4>Prototype Refinement</h4>
            <p>
              The team will develop multiple iterations, focusing on user
              feedback and usability.
            </p>
            <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
            <p>
              Comprehensive testing with end-users to optimize functionality.

          <div id="dissemination-box" class="hidden">
            <h4>Publications and Conferences</h4>
            <p>
              The team will publish findings in international journals and
              present them at conferences related to health, interaction design,
              and digital drawing.
            </p>
            <h4>Online Platform</h4>
            <p>
              A dedicated platform will offer open access to project outputs
              like frameworks, guidelines, and software
            </p>
            <h4>Final Seminar</h4>
            <p>
              A closing event will showcase findings and provide workshops with
